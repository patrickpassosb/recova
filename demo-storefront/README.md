# demo-storefront

A [deco.cx](https://deco.cx) storefront built on **TanStack Start + React 19 + Cloudflare Workers**, with Shopify as the commerce backend.

This is a **site repo** — it consumes the [`@decocms/start`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decocms/start) framework (CMS bridge, admin protocol, worker entry, edge caching) and [`@decocms/apps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decocms/apps) (commerce loaders/actions). UI, sections, and routes live here.

## Stack



| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Cloudflare Workers (`nodejs_compat`) |
| Framework | TanStack Start / TanStack Router |
| UI | React 19 + React Compiler |
| Styles | Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI |
| Build | Vite 7 |
| Data | TanStack Query + TanStack Store, server functions |
| Commerce | Shopify Storefront API (via `@decocms/apps/shopify`) |
| CMS | Deco admin protocol (via `@decocms/start`) |
| Deploy | Wrangler (Cloudflare Workers) |

## Migrating a Deco Fresh storefront to this stack

If you have an existing Deco storefront on the legacy **Fresh + Preact + Deno** stack, the [`@decocms/start`](https://github.com/decocms/deco-start) framework ships a migration CLI that takes you from a Fresh site to a working TanStack Start + Cloudflare Workers site in one pass — this repo is one of the outputs (see `MIGRATION_REPORT.md`).

The script does six phases automatically:

1. **Analyze** — scan source, detect Preact/Fresh/Deco patterns, GTM, commerce platform
2. **Scaffold** — generate `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `src/server.ts`, `src/worker-entry.ts`, `src/router.tsx`, `src/setup.ts`, `src/cache-config.ts`, `src/routes/{__root,$,index,deco/*}`, `src/styles/app.css`, image components, `useCart` / `useUser` / `useWishlist` hooks, types
3. **Transform** — rewrite imports (70+ rules), JSX attrs, Fresh APIs, Deno-isms, Tailwind v3 → v4
4. **Cleanup** — delete `islands/`, old routes, `deno.json`; move `static/` → `public/`
5. **Report** — write `MIGRATION_REPORT.md` with manual review items
6. **Verify** — 18+ smoke tests (zero old imports, scaffolded files exist)

Your existing `src/sections/`, `src/components/`, and `.deco/blocks/` carry over unchanged. The script gets you to "builds clean with zero old imports" — manual work starts at platform hooks (`useCart`) and runtime tuning, tracked in `MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md`.

### Option A — drive the migration through an AI coding tool (recommended)

`@decocms/start` ships an Agent Skill that primes Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other AI coding tools with the full 12-phase migration playbook plus the reference docs and templates. The skill knows what `@decocms/start` supports, runs the migration script for you, and flags anything that needs manual attention as it goes — so you stay in a conversation rather than juggling flags.

Install the skill once:

```sh
npx skills add decocms/deco-start
```

Open your Fresh site in your AI tool and prompt:

> migrate this project to TanStack Start

The agent will analyze the site, run the migration phases, talk through anything ambiguous (CSP domains, site-specific loaders, GTM IDs, custom Fresh handlers), and stop on the manual-review items so you can answer in plain English instead of editing config by hand.

See [`@decocms/start#migrating-from-freshpreactdeno`](https://github.com/decocms/deco-start#migrating-from-freshpreactdeno) for the full skill index.

### Option B — run the migration script manually

If you'd rather drive it yourself, the same logic is exposed as a CLI. From the **root of your existing Fresh site**, with nothing pre-installed:

```sh
# Preview changes (no files written):
npx -p @decocms/start deco-migrate --dry-run --verbose

# Run the migration in place:
npx -p @decocms/start deco-migrate

# Migrate a different directory:
npx -p @decocms/start deco-migrate --source ./my-site
```

Flags:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--source <dir>` | Source directory (default: current directory) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing files |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed output for every file |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help |

After it finishes:

```sh
npm install
npm run generate:blocks
npm run generate:schema
npx tsr generate
npm run dev
```

Then open `MIGRATION_REPORT.md` for the manual review checklist (CSP domains, site-specific loaders, GTM, etc.).

### What's left after the script finishes

Open `MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md` in this repo for the canonical follow-up checklist used during the migration of this site. The recurring patterns are:

- Replace `window.STOREFRONT.*` channels (USER, WISHLIST) with `src/platform/<domain>/` modules following the `cart/` shape: `*.types.ts`, `*.actions.ts` (`createServerFn`), `*.hooks.ts` (`useQuery` + `useMutation`), `*.<commerce>.ts` adapter, `index.ts` barrel.
- Switch internal navigation from `<a href>` to `<Link preload="intent">` from `@tanstack/react-router`.
- Group flat section `Props` into `*Config` sub-interfaces with JSDoc (see `src/sections/Product/ProductDetails.tsx`).
- Add scoped skeletons via `useRouterState({ select: s => s.isLoading })` for the bits that actually change during a route transition.
- Decompose god-components into narrow leaves so React Compiler can auto-memoize them.

## Quick start

Requires Node 20+ and `npm`.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Scripts

| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run deploy` | `npm run build` then `wrangler deploy` |

```

## How rendering works

1. A request hits `src/worker-entry.ts` → `createDecoWorkerEntry` (admin routes, edge cache, CSP, device segmentation).
2. Non-admin requests fall through to the TanStack Start server entry (`src/server.ts`).
3. The catch-all route (`src/routes/$.tsx`) calls the framework's CMS resolver, which loads the page's blocks via `src/server/cms/blocks.gen.ts`.
4. Blocks resolve to sections under `src/sections/`. Sections receive props enriched by their loader and metadata from `applySectionConventions` in `setup.ts`.
5. Commerce data (Shopify PDP, PLP, search, cart) comes from `@decocms/apps/shopify` loaders, wired via `autoconfigApps`.

## Data fetching pattern

Domain state (cart, user, wishlist) follows a single pattern under `src/platform/<domain>/`:

```
<domain>.types.ts     # platform-agnostic state shape
<domain>.actions.ts   # createServerFn wrappers (run on the worker)
<domain>.hooks.ts     # useQuery + useMutation
<domain>.shopify.ts   # adapter: Shopify response → state shape
index.ts              # barrel
```

`src/routes/__root.tsx` prefetches cart + user in `beforeLoad` and seeds the QueryClient. The minicart drawer is mounted at root and driven by the `useCart()` hook.

For navigation, use `<Link from="@tanstack/react-router" preload="intent">` on internal links — never plain `<a href>`.

## Edge caching

The worker entry applies Cloudflare edge cache profiles (defined in `@decocms/start/sdk/cacheHeaders`):

| URL pattern | Profile | Edge TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | static | 1 day |
| `*/p` | product | 5 min |
| `/s`, `?q=` | search | 60s |
| `/cart`, `/checkout` | private | none |
| Everything else | listing | 2 min |

Override per-route in `src/cache-config.ts`.

## Deployment

Cloudflare Workers via Wrangler. Configuration is in `wrangler.jsonc` (entry: `src/worker-entry.ts`).

CI/CD is automatic (see [`.github/workflows/README.md`](./.github/workflows/README.md)):

- **Per-PR previews** — the Cloudflare **Workers Builds** GitHub App builds each PR and posts a sticky comment with the Commit/Branch preview URLs.
- **`deploy.yml`** — on push to `main`, runs `wrangler deploy` with `BUILD_HASH` injected.

Required repo secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.

To deploy manually from your machine:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

For Argo CD / Kubernetes deployment manifests see `deploy/`.
